## How to study probability ? Recommend some learning materials

Studying probability can be very rewarding and useful across various fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, and many others. Here are some recommendations for learning materials to get started with probability:

### Books

1. **"Introduction to Probability" by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis**
   - This book offers a clear introduction to the principles of probability and has many practical examples and exercises.

2. **"A First Course in Probability" by Sheldon Ross**
   - A widely used textbook that provides a thorough introduction to probability theory.

3. **"Probability and Statistics" by Morris H. DeGroot and Mark J. Schervish**
   - This book combines probability and statistics and is useful if you want to understand the statistical applications of probability theory.

4. **"Probability: For the Enthusiastic Beginner" by David Morin**
   - A more informal and approachable book for beginners.

### Online Courses

1. **Khan Academy**
   - Offers a free and comprehensive course on probability, covering basic to advanced topics. The interactive exercises are very helpful.
   - [Khan Academy Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

2. **Coursera**
   - Many universities offer courses on probability through Coursera. For example:
     - "Introduction to Probability and Data" by Duke University
     - "Probability Theory" by National Research University Higher School of Economics

3. **edX**
   - MIT's "Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty" is available on edX.
   - [MITx: 6.041x Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-the-science-of-uncertainty)

### Video Lectures

1. **MIT OpenCourseWare**
   - MIT offers free lecture videos on probability. One notable course is 6.041SC "Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability".
   - [MIT OCW Probability Courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-spring-2014/)

2. **YouTube Channels**
   - Channels like 3Blue1Brown and Khan Academy have excellent videos explaining various probability concepts visually.

### Practice Problems

1. **Project Euler**
   - Provides challenging problems that often involve probability. It's great for applying what you've learned in a practical context.
   - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

2. **Art of Problem Solving**
   - Aimed at high school students and provides a solid foundation in probability with a lot of practice problems.

2. **R and Python Libraries**
   - Libraries such as `prob` in R or `numpy` and `scipy` in Python can be very useful for probability calculations and simulations.

### Study Tips

1. **Understand the Basics**
   - Start with basic concepts such as probability axioms, conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem.

2. **Solve Problems Regularly**
   - Practice is key in probability. Regularly solving problems helps solidify concepts.

3. **Visualize Problems**
   - Use diagrams and charts to understand problems better.

4. **Discuss with Peers**
   - Study groups can be very helpful. Explaining concepts to others also reinforces your understanding.

5. **Stay Curious**
   - Try to see the applications of probability in real life, such as in games, weather forecasting, and risk assessment.

These resources and tips should help you get a strong grasp of probability. Happy studying!
